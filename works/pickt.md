### Web Service for Social Curation of Knowledge Contents

Pickt is a knowledge contents curation service developed with Ruby on Rails.
Motivation was to develope a contents scrapping service similar to Pocket (http://getpocket.com/) or Readability (https://readability.com/) but focused on sharing 'The list of the contents' instead of individual contents so that the package or the sequence of the contents itself could have value as a contents. (Just like blog posts about 'Must Reads')
