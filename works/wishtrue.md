### Online Marketplace for Secondhanded Luxury Products

Wishtrue is a web service for selling secondhanded luxury products developed with Ruby on Rails.
Visually designed by a colleague designer, the whole service from top to bottom was developed by me as a contract developer. I was also responsible for designing the database structure by reflecting the client's business needs.
